## 1.	Introduction:

    Communication between multiple controllers is almost a must when it comes to large projects.
    So, in this Lab we’ll investigate in brief the use of the atmega328, PIC16F877a 
    and the Arduino Uno in some communication scenarios.
    Also come across a few widely used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI.

## 2.	Objectives

    • Explore the communication between multiple microcontrollers.
    • Use Visual Studio Code.
    • Using Proteus as a simulator for such a communication.
    • Use the Arduino Serial Plotter.

## 3.	Requirements

  ### SW requirements:
    • Proteus 8 Professional (or higher compatible versions)
    • Visual Studio code (or any compatible 3rd party IDE)

  ### HW requirements:
    • PIC16F877A
    • PICkit 3 Programmer (or any other working programmer)
    • Crystal 4.000 MHz
    • Arduino Uno
    • Atmega328
    • Arduino Serial cable
    • Multiple male-male jumpers + resistors + capacitors

  ## Prerequisites:

    • Basic understanding of C programming.
    • Basic understanding of the Proteus schematic design.
    • Basic knowledge of HW testing in debugging.
